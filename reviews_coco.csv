Coco is beautiful.Even within the Pixar formula, you can predict almost every beat of the story from only minutes in, and every emotion still hits so hard.

25,"  Pixar movies still make money hand over fist, but it’s hardly a secret that Luxo the lamp isn’t shining quite as bright as it used to. Once upon a time, the company’s animated offerings were genuine cultural events, the best of them (“Ratatouille,” “Finding Nemo”) even meriting comparison to the masterpieces of Studio Ghibli. While their films reliably still clear the low bar set by some of their competition — there’s a world of difference between the noble failure of…  ", ★★★ ,davidehrlich,09 Nov 2017
26, It’s really depressing (and yet also hilarious) that the afterlife in this movie still has class systems and terrible rich people.

32,"  Brightness in the depth of the afterlife's night speckles an impossible cityscape in the hereafter; prismatic neon beasts from the depths of imagination roar, fly, and scramble through the streets; music fills the air with warm, gentle guitar tones.

37, Who could have guessed that the most cathartic rebuke to the culture of abuse and power in the entertainment industry would be the Pixar skeleton movie? , ★★★★ ,Griffin Newman,25 Nov 2017
38," A colorful and vibrant coming of age drama, that treads along in an engaging manner with innovative animations, authentically enjoyable soundtrack and hearty takeaways. It is culturally rooted and beautifully utilizes the metaphysical elements of life and death, to complement its multi generational setting and convey its positive values. With dreams, family and forgiveness as its key themes, it does indeed take you on a highly gratifying journey. ", ★★★★ ,Michael James,07 Oct 2018
39," Achieves the baseline Pixar guarantee of fine, cute, gorgeous, etc, but it really does feel as if they have a contractual obligation to only get the welcome increase in levels of visual sophistication/imagination and cultural specificity as long as they counterbalance it with an equal ratio of boilerplate, mechanical narrative choices. That being said the ending is indeed very nice, I'm not completely made of stone. ", ★★★ ,Josh Lewis,13 Dec 2022

46,"  🏆90%Pixar Ranked list - Click HERETo say “Coco is amazing” feels like an understatement, but that is normally how Pixar operates. Except for my bottom few, the majority of the films under their banner are excellent, as they are one of the best studios in the business (still). Coco works so well because of two elements.

50," It took them 7 years, but with Coco, Pixar finally created a film reminiscent of the magic of their projects in the 2000s. I couldn’t help but to be immediately hooked with our introduction to the world and its characters. — What we end up getting is a truly brilliant and dynamic story about lineage, emotion, and self-discovery. I had my problems with the second act in particular but that final act provided a heartwarming conclusion that tied the story and its magical world-building together perfectly. A must-watch for everybody. ", ★★★★ ,Haris,25 Mar 2024
51,"  58/100Like Brave, often feels more Disney than Pixar—I imagine it's hard to craft a story around a child protagonist without falling back on the ol' vocation-thwarted-by-overprotective-or-uncomprehending-family-members routine. Miguel is far less vivid and memorable than Merida, and Coco, though it boasts a couple of decent plot twists, doesn't take the nutso swerve that made Brave more interesting than the generic empowerment fable it had initially appeared to be. This really is a thoroughly conventional ""follow your dreams""/""family is paramount""…  ", ★★★ ,Mike D'Angelo,03 Dec 2017
52," I love emotional films. I’m a sucker for them. Coco is an emotional film and the tears are inevitable. Miguel’s story takes you on an adventure full of heart, sadness, love, and compassion. This movie is beautiful to watch in both a literal sense and emotional sense. Every shot is filled with excruciating detail and at its core Coco is a heartwarming, sentimental, and culturally sensitive film. It is a stunning work of art that’ll move you from happiness to tears and take you from memories of the past to the joys of the future. It’s a subtle, yet charming and inspiring film. ", ★★★★★ ,George Carmi,
53," No one’s really ever gone as long as we remember them. I suppose life’s great purpose is to make memories and cherish those we love… also play music but I’m not really good at that part. I’m good at singing in the shower though. God this film is so damn great, why did I take this long to watch it. ", ★★★★★ ,alexcolemann,16 Jun 2023

56," Finally another great Pixar movie! Struggles a little in the exposition-heavy first act (no, not talking about that horrific Frozen short), but once things get going, it’s pretty fantastic. The pacing is great, the visuals/music/characters are memorable, and in the end it’s very emotionally affecting, even at the height of its admittedly predictable plot. This film is living proof of animation’s greatest strength: creating fantastical and inventive worlds that simply wouldn’t be possible in live-action. ", ★★★★ ,Houston Coley,25 Nov 2017

60,"  Thankfully has enough Pixar heart to compensate for the negatives of what is ultimately a mixed bag. The first 20-30 minutes are tasked with setting up the story and the family history in particular, and it goes about that in perhaps the most tedious way imaginable. It all feels so lazy and uninspired, and this is especially frustrating coming after having to sit through the excruciating colossal misfire that is ""Olaf's Frozen Adventure"". The story gains some magic when its…  ", ★★★½ ,kevinyang,21 Nov 2017
61,"  Thatcherite/neoliberal afterlife that denies the possibility of collective action within an atomized population of billions of ""individuals"" and even eliminates the idea of ""divine justice"" that's common to all religious depictions of life after death -- exploitative power relationships (and class structures) that existed on earth are reproduced verbatim in the beyond, and the heroic actions of the protag are the only way that crimes committed on earth can be brought to light and rectified, tasks that you'd think would…  ", ★★½ ,Lencho of the Apes,14 Jul 2018
62," Wenn man in einem hermetisch abgeriegelten Kinosaal sitzt und einem trotzdem etwas ins Auge fliegt, dann ist man in einem Pixar-Film. Auch Coco schafft das und man wird danach schon beim Hören des Titels rührselig werden.Animationstechnisch hat Pixar sich selbst geschlagen. Coco ist das neue Nonplusultra der digitalen Detailverliebtheit. Allerdings fällt er ausgerechnet beim Humor gegenüber den ganz, ganz großen Pixars ab. Er fühlt sich deswegen sogar länger an, als er eigentlich ist.Nicht der allergrößte Unterhaltungswert, aber wenn einem ein Film so sehr ans Herz geht, kommt es einfach nicht mehr auf die Anzahl der Lacher an.

Pixar war immer irgendwie...anders.Coco bemüht sich redlich anders zu sein, setzt dabei aber allein auf das ungewöhnliche Setting.

Visually stunning, compelling story and a ridiculously good score, what’s not to love?

A point A-to-B-to-C plot line could have felt formulaic, but an emphasis on individuality without forsaking family or ties as a throughline keeps us cruising. Certainly one of the greatest and most impactful final 10-15 minutes of a movie I've ever seen. Gael García Bernal frantically delivering PG-rated dialogue is very reminiscent of Joe Pesci in Home Alone 1 & 2 - as if I needed any more reason to be on board (with the movie or with the force of nature that is Gael García Bernal in film). This movie makes me so happy. ", ★★★★★ ,Jessica,
159," ”We give you our blessing. No conditions.”A vibrant but bittersweet look at family and the fear of being forgotten. At a deeper level this film tackles a recurring theme of recent Disney/Pixar movies: possessive love. Time and time again we see well intentioned parents & grandparents manage their insecurities under the guise of doing ‘what’s best for the family.’ Coco is without question the most thoughtful and emotional exploration of this trope, while also providing a comforting view of the afterlife.

219," Simply stunning animation. Photo-realistic yet thoroughly stylized in the same scenes. The background score was a little forgettable for me, but the guitar and vocal focused musical sequences were rich and beautiful. The first act or so suffers a bit from feeling a little generic and predictable, leaning into the usual coming of age tropes and some unimpressive humor, but the latter half of the film has enough twists and emotional punch to carry the film through. Perhaps not remarkably original overall, but the touching moments and immense detail put into it is enough to make it stand out. ", ★★★★ ,Freyr,11 Dec 2017

638," I would call this middle-grade Pixar, which means it's still better than most films out there. It begins slow, and Miguel entering the land of the dead doesn't have the same weight as, let's say, a child entering the monster universe. This feels less catastrophic and more ""light"", but the film hits all the right emotional beats and it hits them hard. The movie gets better as it goes on, which is always a nice surprise.

This sentiment is at the core of Pixar’s Coco, a colorfully animated masterpiece celebrating Mexico’s Day of the Dead tradition. The world-building and character-driven elements of the narrative are so intricate and fully realized.

It's also their best work as an animation studio, reveling in the depth of a frame, dotting each environment with a wealth of details, and going hogwild with color and lighting in a way they haven't in a long while. It also manages to be very tightly constructed without sacrificing smaller moments allowing the characters to actually breathe. Just an all-around strong film.

798,"  Coco is purely fantastic. Simply marvelous work from Molina and Unkrich. The amount of times we see Adrian Molina’s name in the end credits shows that this film is a passion project rather than a boardroom decision for Disney-Pixar. It shows; Coco is breathtaking at every turn. It’s Pixar’s most powerful film since Up, it’s their most visually beautiful since WALL•E.

My early pick for best animated feature of the year. Highly recommended for EVERYONE! ", ★★★★★ ,Austin Armstrong,

962," It’s been a couple years, but Pixar has delivered in a big way again. Imagine a cross between Spirited Away and Inside Out with almost all the bad parts taken out, and you have this movie. Every single moment is earned in this emotionally touching story about how sometimes you have to go against your family’s wishes to be who you want to be. This story has been done a million times before, but it does so many subversive, original, and inventive things that I can easily forgive some standard third-act flaws.

979," Wow, I forgot how good this is.Also I’ve realized that most of Pixar's movies are about nostalgia and how memories, fond or not, so strongly influence present experiences, and the idea of memories being timeless is why their films hold-up so well and remain so truthful. Recreate or evolve the past. The best Pixar movies (which really are most of them) mean different things to us at different points in our lives.

Guess that’s part of the problem of having a film that leans so heavily on twists and narrative switcheroos—once you know they’re coming, it takes an awful lot of wind outta the sails.

For a “kids” movie it has important and beautiful messaging if what being a family means. Speaking of beautiful the Land of the Dead is so vibrant.

The tears weren't flowing, and even when I watched it for the second time very recently I didn't get any, but then again it took the third…  ", ★★★★½ ,Hendo (The Movie Journey),28 Jan 2018
1423," Visually stunning, thematically powerful and encapsulating every emotion under the sun, Disney Pixar’s Coco  is a real triumph that stands out from its uniqueness and diversity.I imagine that a rewatch will only be kinder, as weak (by Disney’s standard) promotion and marketing prevented me from fully realising and accepting the tone earlier on into the film. perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2018/01/coco-2018-review.html ", ★★★★ ,nathan,13 Jan 2018

1425,"  Tiempo de fiesta!The Land of the Dead, skeletons, murders? This can only mean one thing - Disney and Pixar have created another family friendly offering. The 19th offering from the super studio is Coco, based on the Mexican holiday Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead) and following the story of Miguel Rivera (Gonzalez), a twelve-year-old aspiring musician desperate to fulfil his musical dreams. His family are deadset against his ambitions becoming reality and so Miguel takes things into…  ", ★★★★ ,Matt Hudson (What I Watched Tonight),07 Jan 2018
1426," I realize that as I grow older, I have less patience with animated family movies. I’m starting to lose that childhood magic and can’t help but get bothered by tiny details and inconsistencies. The first 20 minutes of Coco worried me because I found myself getting annoyed by a lot. But then somehow, I got into it and for a moment I forgot about everything else. The people at Pixar are sorcerers. Coco is pure magic and it WILL warm up your soul whether you let it or not. ", ★★★½ ,Ilinca E.,04 Jan 2018
1427,"  “Though I have to travel far, remember me each time you hear a sad guitar.”when something has the ability to make you proud of where you come from, that is art. my entire mexican family cried the whole time thank you Lee Unkrich!!!Coco is a vibrant, beautiful, song-filled animated film that will make anyone want to sing along and hold their loved ones just a little bit closer. Día de Muertos has been an important holiday in my…  ", ★★★★★ ,sophia,01 Jan 2018
1428," Damn!!!! This was a well told story about the generational bonds that hold a family together as well as old wounds that, when not addressed, can threaten to tear a family apart. It was great to see a Pixar film dive into another culture and share the history behind Dia de los Muertos too. I was holding back tears. I'm not going to lie. Also, never meet your heroes. It never seems to go as planned. ", ★★★★ ,Adam Davie,31 Dec 2017
1429,"  Strini stringi, la Pixar da anni fa sempre lo stesso film sulla paura di essere dimenticati, sull'importanza del ricordo e dei legami familiari e sul processo di crescita del protagonista. Qui e lì ci infila qualche svolta narrativa nuova, qualche invenzione visiva che ti resta impressa e un insegnamento mai banale per gli spettatori più piccini. E alla fine porta a casa (quasi sempre) un risultato clamoroso. Coco non fa eccezione. Sul piano visivo è il solito, raffinatissimo spettacolo stracolmo…  ", ★★★★½ ,Alessandro Di Romolo,29 Dec 2017

1433," Very entertaining, richly animated, full of heart, and containing catchy music, Coco is another quality film from Pixar Studios. However, it doesn’t break any new ground, as it’s a very predictable story with familiar Disney characters and themes. But it’s still worth seeing. ", ★★★★ ,DannyOMovieGuy,10 Dec 2017

1435,  Came early to pickup my ticket and I arrived late to the Frozen short..... The Mexican inside of me always hoped for a Mexican Disney movie. My dream finally came true. The voice actors are great in this and sound great when they speak Spanish and English. The world you see in this movie is so beautiful I wish I can press pause to see how much work they put into the whole city. Some may find the twist I…  , ★★★★★ ,Manny,02 Dec 2017
1436,"  That ending was the best moment in any Pixar film ever. Better than Ego's childhood flashback in Ratatouille and better then the first 10 minutes of Up. This is easily the best Pixar film since Wall-e. Coco is an incredible film that is elevated to a masterpiece by the end. The film surprises you at every turn. The story was extremely enjoyable to follow. The characters were memorable, the animation was absolutely stunning, and the music was phenomenal. Honestly though…  ", ★★★★★ ,Matt,02 Dec 2017

1440," I don't know if I can separate my extremely strong emotional reaction from the movie itself. Besides, I didn't see most of it through my blurry, watery eyes. If this movie has problems, I didn't notice and I don't care. It's extraordinary. ", ★★★★½ ,Jordan Yogurt,28 Nov 2017
1441,"  3.5/5.0 = GreatI'm really glad this is good, and if it weren't a Pixar film it would automatically score much higher due to the sheer magnitude of its impressive world building and beautiful art design. But, I must be honest, COCO really falters for a film that is basically Pixar repeating its well-worn formula for the umpteenth time, so instead of reiterating what everyone already knows is great about COCO, here are the things that didn't work for me.…  ", ★★★½ ,ImmigrantFilm,29 Nov 2017
1442," This movie was so good, it made up for the miserable experience watching that Frozen short and dealing with screaming kids in surround sound. Plus it actually made me shed tears, which is damn near impossible.PS: While this is very much a uniquely Mexican tale, i'll be damned if there isn't a single POC that didn't relate to the pure fear Miguel had when his grandma showed up pissed-off with that slipper, ready to whoop somebody's ass. ", ★★★★★ ,Shak Lambert,28 Nov 2017
1443,"  Here's a funny story. Back in July, I remember channel surfing when I came across an ad for the awful ""Emoji Movie"". In the commercial, Sony described the film as and I quote, ""the perfect family movie of the year"" even though not a single review had been released yet. It was one of the biggest lies I have seen so far this year. The reason why is not only because ""The Emoji Movie"" was appalling like I expected, but because ""Coco"" was…  ", ★★★★★ ,Animated Antic,28 Nov 2017
1444," It’s such a beautiful feeling to see your culture being represented so beautifully on-screen. Suddenly all the conversations, remarks, comments that my mom had made about Día de los Muertos came into focus. As familiar as the sugar skulls, altars, and papel picado are to me, and many others, seeing them in this film made them feel like they were mine, like it was a moment I was sharing with my family.Also, that shot of Miguel entering the Land of the Dead was absolutely stunning. ", ★★★★★ ,Andre,25 Nov 2017
1445,"  Coco is a fully fleshed out and realized project unlike The Good Dinosaur, original as can be despite the complaints that it’s too much like The Book of Life aesthetically, and not a pointless sequel to make a quick million dollars. Coco is an Oscar Contender and practically a shoe-in for Best Animated Picture in a down year for animated films. It’s the type of film that reminds audiences just how special movies can be.

1446,"  Vprento’s 2017 Movies: Best to WorstI am probably the first person (well, me and 50 kids) in my country to watch this latest gem from Pixar. Aside from a few missteps like Brave, The Good Dinosaur and the Cars franchise, Pixar has been the best American animation film studio in the last 20 years. Their stories never cease to amaze me, and Coco certainly fits the bill.I know next to nothing about Mexico's culture and folklore, and yet,…  ", ★★★★½ ,Viktor Prentovski,23 Nov 2017
1447,"  One of the most special and personal films of the year for me, I gotta say!! I'm so glad this worked for me, and that, as far as I can tell, it's getting a favorable reception from other Latinx ppl as well. I'll start off by saying that, in comparison to past Pixar films, I feel like its basic storytelling elements weren't that revolutionary in themselves - there were plenty of times when the plot and dramatic moments felt clobbered…  ", ★★★★½ ,Navil,22 Nov 2017

1449," I knew I would love Coco, but I didn’t think I’d love it THAT much. This is my 3rd favorite Pixar movie now, I loved it so much. If you don’t have Lady Bird or Three Billboards playing near you *cough*me*cough*, go see Coco. You won’t regret it. ", ★★★★★ ,Xavier,21 Nov 2017

1452, This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   Before i begin this review let me start off by telling you a story about my multiple attempts at watching this movie. Back in 2017 and 2018 i heard people talking about how amazing coco is and i was curious to see how great it is and the only problem with that is I didn’t see it in theaters as a kid because i was an idiot and I didn’t know how to watch movies online at the time.

Ok, my bad.Latin America is so big, I’m from Costa Rica, and even being a Latina I’m not quite familiar with Mexican culture overall, cause contrary to what some ignorant people think, we Latinos are each so different.

1459," I’m genuinely angry at this fucken movie. Just sitting here, trying to enjoy a bloody Friday night in, and Coco waltzes in and goes “listen up cunt, want to think about everyone you love who’s dead? Yeahhhhhh cop that dickhead.

1464," While the last 15 minutes are some of the most emotionally powerful work Pixar has ever crafted, the majority of the film felt more like a generic Disney movie than a Pixar film. That being said, visually this is one of the most beautiful animated films ever crafted and it captures the spirit of Mexico perfectly.I could see this rating going way up on a rewatch tbh ", ★★★½ ,Tristan French,25 Nov 2017
1465,"  Avoiding the two extremes of Finding Dory's insipid emptiness and Inside Out's active dysfunction, Pixar's best film in seven years still only achieves a fraction (I'm debating between one half and two thirds) of the magic they used to accomplish with every effort.To its credit, Coco has grand ambitions, and better still, it largely succeeds in marrying them to a very intimate story. The world building is strong – it surely would have captured the imagination of a younger,…  ", ★★★ ,Timothy Lawrence,22 Nov 2017

1482," This review may contain spoilers. I can handle the truth.   “I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story.” Much better than I remember it being the first time I watched it. This was genuinely great. There were some minor issues I had with the movie but nothing too serious.

1484,"  Relatively DeadThis feels like a throwback to classic Pixar. Good story, memorable characters, amazing worlds and a wholesome message to leave with. I love the premise for this film.

This is comprehensively structured storytelling, something that the studio juggernaut has been lacking in spades. This is one of the best screenplays in their catalogue.

As for the Mexican culture, though I am white I grew up in Southern California and live currently in San Antonio so I have a basic understanding, Coco appears to hit the nail on the head without sensationalizing it or bearing down the story with it. The story doesn't go to many great lengths and some things are almost too silly for adults, but Coco will win over one and all whose heart is beating. There's nothing quite like family.

Denim, velvet, gingham, plaster, corn husks, all of them have the fine detail of the real thing.The ending got me choked up like everyone, but I've seen Alzheimer's and senility first hand and the film's sudden cure is a rose-tinted fantasy for an existential horror.

Pixar still has it, anchoring beautiful visuals to a tightly-knit (good lord, is this a perfect example of setups and callbacks) fable of family remembrance.

From the artistic visuals to the characters, this film is beautiful in every way possible.

The normal and spiritual world are both visually stunning and are animated perfectly. For some weird reason i struggle to understand why everyone loves this so much.

After pumping out more sequels, prequels and midquels than I have had hot meals, Pixar finally cranked on the brakes and squeezed out yet another absolute banger to reinvent the animation scene once again.

2088," Coco feels more like a Disney endeavor than a Pixar one - namely, it's safe and formulaic. Sadly, Pixar has been on a steady downtick of originality since around Cars 2 in 2011. And don't tell me Inside Out was an original idea, because I know about Cranium Command, and so does Pete Docter, Inside Out's director. Speaking of Inside Out, Coco lifts a significant plot point from it, as well as a plot twist from Up. Luckily, there's stunning animation to help distract from the sloppy, conventional plotting, as well as emotional beats that effectively strum the heartstrings. ", ★★★½ ,Chance,24 Feb 2018

The original touch here is to use a profound backdrop of death, not as a moment of life, but as a place.

2389," Offering dazzling city and sights yet unseen in modern digital animation, as well as a loving (if slightly shopworn) fable about legacy and rememberance, Pixar's Coco is a reminder of what animation is capable of when the filmmakers venture outside of the box and dream something wild. The world of the Dead is packed with neon shimmer and detail. The pathos are well earned. And the voice cast, which mixes in newcomers as well as seasoned veterans, is up to the task of populating this tale with heartfelt personality and levity. I wish Disney animation followed suit with this sort of visual imagination. ", ★★★★ ,Eddie,19 Jun 2020

Pixar never fails to make great things and while I don’t love everything they do, this is one of the best things they’ve done.

The reason I like Pixar so much is because it combines fiction and reality together in a way that almost makes it impossible not to emphasise with the stories being told, and Coco does this better than most. It’s bursting with colour, fun and emotion, but still manages to keep its important cultural core in place. The story is really intriguing the whole way through too ", ★★★★ ,Becca 💘,28 Mar 2020

Being absolutely forgotten is one of the most terrifying things in a bone-deep, existential way. It's a very emotional film, but also Frida Kahlo's show made me bust a gut. The tone is well-managed with the laughs not glib or childish and the emotional moments not overwrought. ""Un Poco Loco"" slaps. It seems like the official Cry Moment is Miguel singing ""Remember Me"" to Mama Coco, but I got the feels when Hector was finally able to cross over the bridge. ", ★★★★★ ,megan,09 Jul 2019

Just now I'm really hit by the final scene of the film and realizing just how rewarding and satisfying it actually is.

And the character designs, once he crosses over into the land of the dead, are fun and unlikely to scare smaller children. The film also served…  ", ★★★ ,Kaisersoze,25 Nov 2017

The story seemed to move at the perfect trajectory to make me completely overwhelmed by the journey of the family.

2563," Warm colors evolve into a bright remembrance of faded love and lost memories. Hues pop in the vibrations of the music connecting generations. Pixar at its most colorfully playful, weaving such strong musically-visual emotion into every beat; Lee Unkrich is clearly the animated maestro of accepting death and knowing life is more beautiful surrounded by who you love, with each moment powered by what you love.

There are lots of interesiting themes at play, the idea of being remembered, bastardized legacies, and the dangers of music, but none of the themes ever develop beyond what they start out as, especially the last one.

But once it gets there, it's pure fun and emotion. The logistics of how the Day of the Dead works are wonderfully accomplished--worldbuilding that doesn't feel tedious, but entertaining. The series of reveals are predictable, but manage to seem organically inevitable, instead of face-smackingly obvious. And the end is the best kind of Pixar tearjerking. I wish it had started out stronger, but it ended on a high note. ", ★★★★ ,Scrawler,

3044,"  Más que la historia y los aspectos técnicos, la grandeza de la película radica en la alusión que le hacen a la familia constantemente. Claramente está llena de clichés y quizás no te identificas con ninguno de los personajes, pero aquellos que hemos crecido rodeado por nuestra familia se nos es difícil sentir aversión a una historia tan familiar, que cada 5 minutos te está recordando la importancia de tener a tu familia al lado y de ser apoyado por…  ", ★★★★ ,jduica,14 Jan 2018
3045," Watched At : Odeon What!! A Disney film that I didn't really enjoy. How is that possible? The premise of the story was a fascinating one before I went in. I just never got a real kick out of it. Animation was superb, music was fine. But I never felt anything for the characters. Hopefully this may change on a second watch ! ", ★★★ ,Russell,14 Jan 2018

3048," Beautiful and emotional; Coco is brilliant fun with plenty of laughs throughout. Great for kids - though perhaps not the ones afraid of skeletons, as the little girl sat behind me was - and just as great for big kids. Coco is visually stunning and sure to scoop the best animation Oscar. ", ★★★★½ ,Abi Crowe,
3049,"  This is the only time I'm thankful New Zealand got this movie later as Frozen fever didn't play. I hope from now on disney has learned to let Pixar make their own shorts for their movies. Anyway this was a great Pixar movie!! The animation, characters and music are fantastic. I was especially impressed by the movie embracing Mexican culture. Obviously I don't know first hand how accurate it was but I FELT immersed in the world it created. For…  ", ★★★★ ,Emma Grace,11 Jan 2018

3052,"  Wish I could summon any strong feelings about this, but I can't, and the acclaim this continues to garner just makes me have to have strong feelings about my lack of strong feelings in order to keep up a conversation about it and it's totally mind-numbing and also completely my own fault. Certainly less frustrating in that regard than, say, Inside Out, but it also hits a lot of the same emotional beats that that movie did (angst leading to…  ", ★★½ ,JKM,13 Dec 2017
3053," Well this was lovely, wasn't it? Makes the whole Day of the Dead thing sound like something everybody should be doing, all while positing a fantastical, celebratory afterlife that still makes room for a spooky, sad, inevitable unknown. ", ★★★★ ,"Brian J. ""Tyrannorabbit"" Wright",07 Jan 2018
3054,"  This fell pretty short of greatness for me, which is disappointing given Lee Unkrich's involvement, but Coco is nevertheless another reliably charming, visually stunning, affecting Pixar animation.The main thing holding this back is that the premise lacks the cleverness of, say, Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Inside Out; the mechanics of the life/death aren't especially fresh, and the main theme of ""family is everything"" feels fairly trite, even corny, to me, especially with how many high-profile movies have tried…  ", ★★★½ ,Shaun Munro,07 Jan 2018

3058,"  The experience of watching Coco was, to me, one of the best experiences I ever had with a Pixar film. Whilst gathering heavy issues from the political real world and transforming it into a great message of family and unity, this film showcases Pixar's best form from the script to cinematography. Immerse in a vivid purple, the world from the death in Coco has many celebrities from the real world, and is just as rich as any setting in movies.…  ", ★★★★★ ,Michel Amaral,05 Jan 2018
3059," Fantastic. Excellent job, Pixar! I loved this film from start to finish. Though some parts of the plot were a little predictable, there were a few good twists as well.The colors, music, graphics, and use of culture and language were outstanding. Disney/Pixar needs to continue on this path of storytelling. I’d take 50 Coco’s before a single Frozen sequel. God I loved this. Definitely plan to see it again, I was teary eyed mess by the end, and honestly so relieved how nicely it was executed. Viva la Coco! ", ★★★★½ ,awittyusername,04 Jan 2018
3060,"  É preciso dizer que a Pixar acertou de novo. E acertou em cheio.“Viva- A Vida é Uma Festa” é um dos filmes mais coloridos e inclusivos do estúdio. Embora não tenha a sagacidade de “Divertida Mente”, meu favorito, tem personagens carismáticos e um elenco de dubladores impecável. Ambientado no México, mas precisamente na celebração do “Dia dos Mortos”, a animação recicla as clássicas histórias com apelo familiar e mesmo que não pareça original, algumas outras animações recentes já abordaram…  ", ★★★★½ ,Israel Matos,04 Jan 2018

3062, Beautifully animated and entertaining but not as great as everyone is making it be. There were some beautiful songs and the voice acting was also pretty good but the concept or the execution was nothing new. As for an animated film that concerns about Day of the Dead I prefer The Book of Life. There were some obvious attempts at some political commentary that fell flat for me. The story was also quite predictable nonetheless a fun watch where they kept their respect for the culture. , ★★★ ,Jithin K Mohan,04 Jan 2018

3065," Just as good the second time. Possibly my favorite Pixar movie. Gets easily as emotional - if not more so - than Toy Story 3, but doesn't have the benefit of three movies of character build up. Yet everything that it sets up is perfectly deserving and heartfelt. ", ★★★★★ ,Dustin Nowak,27 Dec 2017
3066," The animation in Coco is gorgeous - let's get that out of the way first. The movie has the standard ""be yourself"" moral, but as you can imagine, the team at Pixar finds nuances the play with that most studios wouldn't notice. I can't speak to how faithful the film is to Mexican culture, but it's great seeing that diversity in story, storytelling, and even storytellers. Pixar movies tend to make me cry, but I was weepy throughout the last ten minutes of Coco. Good work. ", ★★★★ ,Steven Cohen,27 Nov 2017
3067,"  “Know that I’m with you the only way that I can be...”in my mind, this lovely, vibrant spiritual musical earns a spot among the ranks of Pixar’s best. while its adherence to the classic hero’s journey threatens to feel a tad bit formulaic at times, Coco nevertheless delivers a compelling narrative that engages timeless themes with energy and stunning visual flair, achieving genuine pathos through a downright beautiful meditation on love, loss, and family. from what I’ve heard at least,…  ", ★★★★★ ,Evan B,23 Dec 2017

Easy to predict plotwise, but still a visual feast and emotionally fufilling experience for child & adult alike. ", ★★★★ ,Sarah McMullan,02 Dec 2017

3071,"  “Never underestimate the power of music.”‘Coco’ is a richly detailed tale of familial traditions, the celebration of living life and also the celebration of what comes after life. Pixar is the film studio who’s efforts are all extremely admirable, even the ones that are considerably lesser than some of their more stronger efforts. But with ‘Coco’, they have reached a new level of visual storytelling with its stunning animation and the film’s incredibly detailed world building and environments.
